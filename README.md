## Tech stuff
This is purely a frontend-only app created with create-react-app and rebass for the ui framework. 

I wanted to create a frontend project with a mobile-first design and landed on this. I also wanted to have a bootstrap Terraform setup for any frontend project so I went ahead and included that here as well.
